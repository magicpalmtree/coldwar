<h1>Cold War</h1>

<p>
  Cold War models the escalation and execution of nuclear combat.
</p>

<p>
  You can experiment with different scenarios to game
  out possible results.
</p>

<p>
  An Actor is any element in the game. Actors follow rules over time.
  These rules determine the actor's behaviour.
</p>

<p>
  There are two views, top view and elevation view. All the actors have
  an x, y and z position on the surface or in airspace.
</p>

<p>
  Each of the circled groupings is a nation state. It is controlled by
  it's Capital.
</p>

<p>
  The Capital is at the center of the Nation State. (square,
  blinking). The lower the Defcon number in the Capital, the more
  aggressive the Nation State will be.
</p>

<p>
  Cities (circles) send people to work at factories.
</p>

<p>
  Factories (triangles) make munitions and send them to bases
</p>

<p>
  Bases (square) stockpile munitions (counts, clockwise from top right:
  icbms, abms (anti ballistic missiles), fighters and bombers.
</p>

<p>
  Bombers are big and slow (triangles) that select a target (factory,
  base, city, capital in that order), fly to it and nuke it, re-selecting
  a target if somebody else destroys it first.
</p>

<p>
  As deeper defence perimeters are penetrated, Defcon gets more scary.
</p>

<p>
  Fighters launch at Defcon 4 and attempt to destroy bombers.
</p>

<p>
  At Defcon 3, Bases launch ICBMs a low probability amount of the time.
</p>

<p>
  Satellites launch at Defcon 2, and can shoot ICBMs out of the sky, but
  have fire/recharge lasers, so won't get them all.
</p>

<p>
  When one of a nation's assets (factory, base, city) is nuked, they go
  to Defcon 1.
</p>

<p>
  If your enemy goes to Defcon 1, so do you.
</p>

<p>
  At Defcon 1, all ICBMs will fire.
</p>

<p>
  When your capital is destroyed, it's Game Over.
</p>

<p>
  The control panel lets you tweak the starting parameters. There are a
  lot more controls for all the actors (e.g, how close do bombers
  flock.) that are not exposed here.
</p>

<p>
  This is Version 0.2.
